# Computer Architecture
This repository contains a graduate-level project which is designing an embedded microprocessor in SystemVerilog.
First of all, the design has its own Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) based on RISC-V. [ISA_M2Y_ver1.2.pdf](https://github.com/memreduman/Computer-Architecture/files/13467790/ISA_M2Y_ver1.2.pdf)
